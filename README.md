# Color-Detection
Color Detection Project Using Python and OpenCV

🎨🔍 A Color Detection project built with Python and OpenCV that lets you identify colors in images by clicking on them!

📸 Features:

    Load any image and identify colors with a simple double-click.
    Display color names, RGB values, and colored rectangles for selected pixels.
    Algorithmically match clicked colors with the closest color names in the dataset.

🚀 This project serves as an excellent introduction to image processing and GUI applications with Python and OpenCV.

🔧 Feel free to explore, modify, and expand upon the code to create your own color-based applications.
